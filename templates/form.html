			It’s like hiking but better! You can stay out in the field for a single night, or for a whole month or more. Backpacking is truly the ideal way to escape from everything. It doesn’t even have to be difficult. Start simply, and work up from there. If there’s a better way to find peace, I haven’t found it yet!If you want to be outside, but for whatever reason, long-distance treks aren’t quite your thing, try some simple camping. From your backyard to the campground in your local state park, there’s always a good place to camp.It’s the fastest growing recreational sport in America! It’s easy to learn, suitable for all ages and super social – not to mention great exercise. You won’t need much to get started – just a paddle, a few balls, and a rudimentary knowledge of the rules.Whether your idea of fishing is wading through a river in search of trout or kicking back lakeside, you’ll find that this hobby can be as exciting or as laid back as you make it. And like hunting, it results in a delicious dinner. Other types of fishing include ice, fly, kayak, and bass fishing. Just make sure to fish responsibly and get a permit!The water is yet another perfect place to find peace. There is no feeling that can quite replicate the feeling of crashing over waves in a storm or fighting the wind with every stroke. You can canoe on rivers, lakes, ponds; anywhere there’s water, you can canoe.
